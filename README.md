This project recreates the basic functionality of Google Search across three pages:

- Below the search bar are two buttons:

  - **I'm Feeling Lucky** – Directs the user straight to the first result (may show a redirect notice due to Google’s security).
- Top-right navigation links to:
  - Image Search**
  - Advanced Search**

 2. Image Search Page (`image.html`)
- Allows users to enter a query and click a button to view Google Image search results.

  - All these words

  - Any of these words
  - None of these words
- Inputs are stacked vertically and left-aligned.
